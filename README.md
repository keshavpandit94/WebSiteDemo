My First HTML & CSS Project: Creating a Card
Introduction
Welcome to my first project in learning HTML and CSS! ðŸŽ‰ I'm excited to share my journey as I dive into web development by building a simple, yet stylish, card. This project is a stepping stone for me as I learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I'll be using this README to document my progress and share what Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

Project Overview
In this project, I created a card component, which is commonly used in websites to showcase content in a visually appealing way. The card includes:

A Title: The main heading of the card.
An Image: A representative image for the content.
A Description: Some text describing the content of the card.
A Button: A call-to-action button for further interaction.
Learning Goals
My primary goals for this project were:

Understand Basic HTML Structure: Learning how to structure a webpage using HTML tags.
Learn Basic CSS Styling: Understanding how to apply styles to HTML elements to enhance the visual appearance.
Responsive Design: Ensuring that the card looks good on different screen sizes.
Improve Code Organization: Writing clean and organized code for better readability and maintenance.

HTML Structure
I used the following HTML structure to create the card:
html
 <h1>Players Cards</h1>
    <div id="main">
        <div id="card1" class="card">
            <img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/rohit-sharma-1-2024-07-f31b2b81746e93de6ab1c683fc455ff0.jpg?impolicy=website&width=640&height=480" alt="">
        </div>
        <div id="card2" class="card">
            <img src="https://d3pc1xvrcw35tl.cloudfront.net/ln/images/685x514/screenshot-2024-06-29-212915_202406763456.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div id="card3" class="card">
            <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GOwuBg6WkAASYOx?format=jpg&name=large" alt="">
        </div>
        <div id="card4" class="card">
            <img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/hardik-pandya-030641506-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=bpzHQCVPz6VGQRcLpdvB0kmGGFvrXqMk&size=690:388" alt="">
        </div>
    </div>
    
CSS Styling
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the CSS used to style the card:
css
h1{
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
    text-decoration: underline solid;
    font-size: 70px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: cadetblue;
}

#main{
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: burlywood;
}

.card{
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    /* transform: translate(-50%,-50%); */
    height: 300px;
    width: 230px;
    border: 2px solid orange;
    border-radius: 20px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

#card1{
    z-index: 4;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
    /* rotate: 30deg; */
    background-color: antiquewhite;
}


#card2{
    z-index:3 ;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%) rotate(-6deg);
    /* rotate: -6deg; */
    background-color: aquamarine;
}
Not full code only some examples 

Responsive Design
To ensure the card looks great on all devices, I utilized media queries to adjust the card's layout for smaller screens.

css
Copy code
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .card {
    width: 100%;
  }
}

Challenges & Learnings
Throughout the process, I encountered a few challenges, such as:

Centering Elements: I struggled initially with centering elements vertically and horizontally but learned different techniques like flexbox to achieve it.
Responsive Design: Making the card responsive was tricky at first, but experimenting with media queries helped me understand how to handle different screen sizes.
What's Next?
Moving forward, I plan to:

Explore More CSS Properties: Dive deeper into CSS to learn about animations, transitions, and advanced layouts.
Build More Projects: Create more complex projects to reinforce my learning and gain confidence in my skills.
Conclusion
This project was a great introduction to HTML and CSS. It helped me grasp the basics and gave me the confidence to continue learning. Iâ€™m excited to keep building and sharing my journey!

My Second HTML & CSS Project: Building a Basic Website
Introduction
After successfully creating a card in my first project, I decided to take on a bigger challengeâ€”building a basic website! ðŸš€ This project helped me dive deeper into HTML and CSS, as I learned how to structure a multi-page website and style it with CSS. Iâ€™m excited to share the details of this project in this README.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a simple, multi-page website that includes:

Home Page: An introductory page with a navigation menu and a welcoming section.
About Page: A page describing the purpose of the website or more information about myself.
Contact Page: A page with a contact form for visitors to get in touch.
Learning Goals
My learning objectives for this project were:

Create a Multi-Page Structure: Understanding how to link multiple pages together using HTML.
Advanced CSS Styling: Experimenting with more complex CSS properties, such as flexbox and grid.
Responsive Web Design: Ensuring the website is accessible and looks good on various devices.
Navigation and Layouts: Creating a consistent navigation menu and layout for all pages.

    </form>
  </section>

  <footer>
    <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
CSS Styling
The following CSS file (styles.css) is used to style the entire website:

css
Copy code
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

header {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px 0;
  text-align: center;
}

nav ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

nav ul li {
  display: inline;
  margin: 0 10px;
}

nav ul li a {
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
}

section {
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 20px;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 8px;
}

footer {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10px 0;
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
}

form {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

form label {
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

form input,
form textarea {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

form button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

form button:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  nav ul li {
    display: block;
    margin: 10px 0;
  }

  section {
    margin: 10px;
  }
}
Responsive Design
The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. The CSS media query above helps adjust the layout for smaller screens, making the navigation menu stack vertically and the sections adjust their margin.

Challenges & Learnings
In this project, I faced and overcame several challenges:

Creating a Navigation Menu: Designing a consistent and functional navigation menu across all pages.
Form Styling: Learning how to style form elements effectively and ensure they are user-friendly.
Responsive Design: Making the website responsive across different devices, especially handling the navigation menu on mobile.
What's Next?
Next, I plan to:

Add More Pages: Expand the website by adding more pages and content.
Explore JavaScript: Start incorporating JavaScript to add interactivity to the website.
Improve Design Skills: Learn more about design principles to create more aesthetically pleasing layouts.
Conclusion
This project was a significant step forward in my journey to learn web development. By creating a basic website, I gained confidence in using HTML and CSS and built a solid foundation to continue my learning. I'm excited to explore more advanced topics and share my progress!
