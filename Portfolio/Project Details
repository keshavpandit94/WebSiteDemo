Project Title: Portfolio Website
Project Description:
For my third project, I built a responsive portfolio website using HTML and CSS.

The website is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes.
Custom CSS Styling: Handcrafted styles to ensure a unique and polished look.
Navigation Bar: A fixed navigation bar with smooth scrolling links.
Project Showcase: A dedicated section highlighting my key projects with images and descriptions.
About Me Section: A brief introduction with information about my skills, experience, and contact details.
Contact Form: A functional contact form that allows visitors to send me messages directly from the site.


Technologies Used:
HTML5: For the structure of the website.
CSS3: For styling and layout.
Flexbox & Grid: To create a responsive and organized layout.
Media Queries: To ensure the site is mobile-friendly.
