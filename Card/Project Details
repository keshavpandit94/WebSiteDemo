My First HTML & CSS Project: Creating a Card
Introduction
Welcome to my first project in learning HTML and CSS! ðŸŽ‰ I'm excited to share my journey as I dive into web development by building a simple, yet stylish, card. This project is a stepping stone for me as I learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I'll be using this README to document my progress and share what Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

Project Overview
In this project, I created a card component, which is commonly used in websites to showcase content in a visually appealing way. The card includes:

A Title: The main heading of the card.
An Image: A representative image for the content.
A Description: Some text describing the content of the card.
A Button: A call-to-action button for further interaction.
Learning Goals
My primary goals for this project were:

Understand Basic HTML Structure: Learning how to structure a webpage using HTML tags.
Learn Basic CSS Styling: Understanding how to apply styles to HTML elements to enhance the visual appearance.
Responsive Design: Ensuring that the card looks good on different screen sizes.
Improve Code Organization: Writing clean and organized code for better readability and maintenance.
Project Details

HTML Structure
I used the following HTML structure to create the card:
html
 <h1>Players Cards</h1>
    <div id="main">
        <div id="card1" class="card">
            <img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/rohit-sharma-1-2024-07-f31b2b81746e93de6ab1c683fc455ff0.jpg?impolicy=website&width=640&height=480" alt="">
        </div>
        <div id="card2" class="card">
            <img src="https://d3pc1xvrcw35tl.cloudfront.net/ln/images/685x514/screenshot-2024-06-29-212915_202406763456.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div id="card3" class="card">
            <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GOwuBg6WkAASYOx?format=jpg&name=large" alt="">
        </div>
        <div id="card4" class="card">
            <img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/hardik-pandya-030641506-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=bpzHQCVPz6VGQRcLpdvB0kmGGFvrXqMk&size=690:388" alt="">
        </div>
    </div>
    
CSS Styling
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the CSS used to style the card:
css
h1{
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
    text-decoration: underline solid;
    font-size: 70px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: cadetblue;
}

#main{
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: burlywood;
}

.card{
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    /* transform: translate(-50%,-50%); */
    height: 300px;
    width: 230px;
    border: 2px solid orange;
    border-radius: 20px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

#card1{
    z-index: 4;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
    /* rotate: 30deg; */
    background-color: antiquewhite;
}


#card2{
    z-index:3 ;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%) rotate(-6deg);
    /* rotate: -6deg; */
    background-color: aquamarine;
}
Not full code only some examples 

Responsive Design
To ensure the card looks great on all devices, I utilized media queries to adjust the card's layout for smaller screens.

css
Copy code
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .card {
    width: 100%;
  }
}

Challenges & Learnings
Throughout the process, I encountered a few challenges, such as:

Centering Elements: I struggled initially with centering elements vertically and horizontally but learned different techniques like flexbox to achieve it.
Responsive Design: Making the card responsive was tricky at first, but experimenting with media queries helped me understand how to handle different screen sizes.
What's Next?
Moving forward, I plan to:

Explore More CSS Properties: Dive deeper into CSS to learn about animations, transitions, and advanced layouts.
Build More Projects: Create more complex projects to reinforce my learning and gain confidence in my skills.
Conclusion
This project was a great introduction to HTML and CSS. It helped me grasp the basics and gave me the confidence to continue learning. Iâ€™m excited to keep building and sharing my journey!
